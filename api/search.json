This debate has been raging for so long that it usually raises little more than a shrug of indifference. _That is no longer a defensible response. A new report from the organisation Scientists for Global Responsibility (SGR) exposes problems so serious that we can no longer afford to be indifferent to them.\nSection 1The report looks at the impact of five commercial sectors on science and technology over the past 20 years. The damaging influence of two of these, pharmaceuticals and tobacco, has been noted before. But we also looked at the oil and gas, defence and biotech sectors, which have been subjected to less scrutiny. We found a wide range of disturbing commercial influences on science, and evidence that similar problems are occurring across academic disciplines.\nOver the past two decades, government policy in the US, UK and elsewhere has fundamentally altered the academic landscape in a drive for profit.Universities have been pushed to adopt a much more commercial mindset, from taking out patents to prioritising research that promises short-term economic gains. The rapid spread of partnerships between businesses and universities has led to some disciplines becoming so intertwined with industry that few academics are able to retain their independence. Chemical engineering and geology are strongly linked to oil companies, for example, and it is hard to find an engineering department in the UK which does not receive funding from the arms industry. And many life sciences departments have extensive links with the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries.\nSection 2This creates enormous potential for conflicts of interest. The problem has long been recognised in medical research, and journals are starting to crack down on it, but in other disciplines the problems are rarely even discussed, let alone acted upon. Such problems are a major concern because they can undermine the quality and reliability of research. This is perhaps best illustrated by ‘sponsorship bias’, where research generates results that suit the funder (The Journal of the American Medical Association, 290, p 921). Another well-documented problem is the failure to report results unfavourable to the funder.\nResearch is also undermined by misleading messages put out by industry-funded lobby groups. Again, these tactics are well known from the tobacco and oil industries, with their deliberate questioning of health research and sponsorship of climate sceptics. Less attention has been given to the funding of some patient groups by pharmaceutical companies and the (sometimes covert) use of PR companies by the biotechnology industry in the debate over genetically modified crops. This does not bode well for public discussions on the risks of synthetic biology.\nSection 3Another cornerstone of science that is being eroded is the freedom to set the public research agenda so that it serves the public interest. Governments are increasingly focused on delivering competitiveness, and business interests are able to exert pressure on funding bodies through representatives on their boards. As a result, environmental and social problems and ‘blue-sky’ research commonly lose out to short-term commercial gain. For example, genetics now dominates agricultural science, not least because genetic technologies are highly patentable. This not only dominates privatelyfunded research, but also steers publicly-funded research away from work that takes a different approach or explores low-tech solutions. As a result, ‘low-input’ agriculture, which requires minimal use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides and is cheaper and more useful to poorer farmers, is largely overlooked. Similarly, research on how to improve food distribution receives inadequate support.\nSection 4Another example is research on security issues, which is overwhelmingly focused on new military technology. Research into understanding the roots of conflict, or to support negotiation and reconciliation programmes, receives a tiny fraction of the tens of billions of dollars spent globally on developing military hardware. And most of that is public money. Put bluntly, much publicly-funded science is no longer being done in the public interest. Despite this, policymakers are complacent and argue that any damaging effects of commercial influence are minor. In contrast, many scientists are noticing the effects and becoming discomfited by them. Some are starting to speak out. For example, staff at the Open University in the UK are pushing for new ethical standards for business partnerships following the university’s involvement in a major military contract. However, these campaigns are few and far between. There is a strong incentive for scientists not to make a fuss if their department receives industry funds. This is strengthened by contractual requirements for secrecy that often come with industry partnerships.\nConclusionTo defend independent science, reform is needed, from the level of government policy down to that of the research study. To this end, SGR is making recommendations. These include: the open publication of all funding arrangements between academia and business; ethical standards for business–university partnerships; proper handling of conflicts of interest by journals; more involvement of the public in setting research priorities; and a change in government policies which prioritise research with short-term commercial priorities above all else. Scientists must now voice their concerns publicly in order that policy-makers hear them. They could do worse than follow the example set by campaigners at theOpen University.\n\nStuart Parkinson and Chris Langley are authors of theSGR report Science and the Corporate Agenda, which can be downloaded from sgr.org.uk.Source: Adapted from Parkinson, S., &amp; Langley, C.

Focusing on Plot, Structure, and RhythmWhat is a good story in terms of plot?A good story is one where the plot is compelling and well-structured. It’s not just a sequence of events but a carefully crafted journey that keeps the audience engaged. Great stories often follow certain patterns or principles that make them effective, including a clear structure, proper pacing, and well-timed plot twists.\nLet’s take the Lord of the Rings trilogy as an example. The plot is complex and filled with subplots, but it follows a clear path: a group of diverse characters embarks on a perilous journey to destroy an evil ring. The story unfolds through various challenges, character developments, and moments of tension that lead to the ultimate resolution.\nWhy are plot structure and rhythm important?1. The Three-Act StructureOne of the most commonly used plot structures is the three-act structure. The first act sets up the world and characters, introduces the main conflict, and sets the story in motion. For example, in The Hunger Games, Katniss volunteers as tribute, which establishes the stakes. Strong stories often incorporate foreshadowing in this act, subtly hinting at future events. In Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone, Harry’s ability to talk to snakes foreshadows his deeper connection to Voldemort.\nThe second act involves rising action, where the protagonist faces escalating difficulties, and tension builds. This is where foreshadowing begins to pay off, and the story introduces pivotal plot twists that keep the audience on edge. In The Dark Knight, the Joker’s unpredictable moves continually subvert expectations, making the second act intense and gripping.\nThe third act is where all the clues and twists come together, leading to a resolution. If foreshadowing is well-placed and the twists are logical, the ending feels earned and satisfying. For instance, in The Sixth Sense, the twist at the end is shocking yet makes perfect sense because of the subtle hints laid throughout the story.\n2. The Hero’s JourneyMany successful stories follow a narrative framework called The Hero’s Journey, popularized by Joseph Campbell. This structure involves a protagonist leaving their ordinary world, encountering challenges, and returning transformed. Stories like Star Wars and The Lion King follow this structure, where the protagonist grows, learns something new, and ultimately overcomes the central conflict.\n3. RhythmA good story has a well-paced rhythm. The pacing refers to how fast or slow the story unfolds and is critical to maintaining audience interest.\nI wonder if you’ve ever heard of the refrigerator theory? Viewers may not notice plot holes during the excitement of watching but realize them later, perhaps when standing in front of the fridge at night. “Hey! That doesn’t make any sense at all. “\nFor example, Mad Max: Fury Road is a non-stop chase that leaves little room for the audience to question the logic of certain scenes. The tight rhythm keeps the audience immersed and thoroughly enjoying the experience.\nOf course, that’s not to say that a slow pace is bad either.In contrast, a film like The Godfather takes its time, allowing moments of silence and reflection to deepen the emotional stakes.\nWhy is this important for a good story?A good plot structure and pacing help guide the audience through the story while maintaining interest. A clear structure ensures the story feels satisfying and purposeful, while pacing keeps it exciting and engaging. Without these elements, even the most interesting characters or settings can feel directionless or drag on.\nA good story relies on strong structure, balanced pacing, and well-executed twists. By incorporating foreshadowing and twists into a three-act structure and using pacing to temporarily mask logical issues (as explained by the Fridge Theory), storytellers can create narratives that captivate audiences in the moment and hold up under later scrutiny.\nThank you!\n什么是一个好故事？关注剧情、结构和节奏什么是一个好故事，从剧情角度来看？一个好的故事是一个引人入胜且结构巧妙的剧情。它不仅仅是事件的简单叙述，而是一个精心构建的旅程，能够保持观众的兴趣。伟大的故事通常遵循某些共同的模式或原则，使其更有效，包括清晰的结构、适当的节奏和恰到好处的剧情转折。\n举个例子，以《指环王》三部曲为例。剧情复杂，充满了子情节，但它遵循了一个清晰的路径：一群不同的角色踏上危险的旅程，目的是摧毁一枚邪恶的戒指。通过各种挑战、角色的发展和紧张时刻，故事逐步展开，最终达到解决冲突的高潮。\n为什么剧情结构和节奏如此重要？  \n\n三幕剧结构最常用的剧情结构之一是三幕剧结构。第一幕设置故事背景和角色，介绍主要冲突并推动情节开始。在 《饥饿游戏》 中，凯妮丝自愿成为贡品的瞬间奠定了故事基调。优秀的故事往往在第一幕中埋下前兆，为未来的情节发展铺垫。例如，在 《哈利·波特与魔法石》 中，一开始哈利与蛇交流的片段为他后来与伏地魔的关系埋下伏笔。\n第二幕是情节的发展阶段，主角面临层层障碍，紧张感逐步加剧。此时，前兆开始逐渐显现，而观众的注意力集中在不断升级的冲突上。到了第二幕，剧情转折尤为关键。这些转折必须自然且令人意想不到。例如，在 《黑暗骑士》 中，小丑的计划不断升级，观众的期待被一次次颠覆，保持高度紧张感。\n第三幕是高潮阶段，所有伏笔得到回收，冲突得到解决。如果前面的前兆埋得巧妙，剧情转折处理得当，观众会对故事的结局感到满意。像 《第六感》 的结局通过一系列前兆和巧妙的转折让观众既震惊又感到故事合理。\n\n节奏和韵律一个好的故事拥有良好的节奏。节奏指的是故事展开的速度，掌握节奏至关重要。\n比如，《疯狂的麦克斯：狂怒道》几乎是一个两小时的追逐场景，但它的节奏掌握得恰到好处。剧情不断向前推进，短暂的对话和动作交替进行，没有停留太长时间在任何一个情节上，这让观众始终保持紧张感。相比之下，《教父》则花费更多时间让情感和反思沉淀，慢慢加深情节的情感层次。\n\n英雄之旅许多成功的故事遵循了英雄之旅的叙事框架，这一框架由约瑟夫·坎贝尔提出。这一结构包括主人公离开平凡世界，遇到挑战，并在经历一系列事件后成长，最终战胜中心冲突。像《星球大战》和《狮子王》这样的故事就遵循了这一结构，主人公在经历成长、学习后最终战胜冲突。\n\n\n这些为什么对一个好故事如此重要？一个好的剧情结构和节奏有助于引导观众了解故事的发展，同时保持他们的兴趣。清晰的结构确保故事感觉有目的性，且能够带给观众一种满足感，而节奏则能保持紧张感和吸引力。如果没有这些元素，即使是最有趣的角色或场景也可能让故事感觉失去方向或拖沓。\n一个好的故事依赖于稳固的结构、恰当的节奏和巧妙的转折。通过在三幕剧结构中融入前兆与转折，并利用节奏来暂时掩盖潜在的逻辑问题（冰箱理论），创作者可以打造出既能让观众当下沉浸其中，又能经得起事后推敲的精彩故事。\n谢谢大家！  \n材料《第六感》（The Sixth Sense）是一部1999年的心理惊悚片，讲述了一名儿童心理医生马尔科姆（布鲁斯·威利斯饰）试图帮助一名叫科尔的男孩（海利·乔·奥斯蒙饰），这个男孩声称自己能够看到已故的灵魂。科尔饱受这些“鬼魂”的困扰，生活在恐惧之中。随着故事的推进，马尔科姆逐渐揭开了科尔能力背后的真相，并帮助他学会与这些灵魂沟通。然而，影片的最大亮点是最后的剧情反转——马尔科姆发现自己其实早已在一场枪击事件中身亡，他帮助科尔的过程实际上也是他自己接受死亡现实的旅程。这一反转令观众震惊，也让整部电影充满回味。\n麦坎·寇罗医师是美国宾夕法尼亚州费城的一名杰出儿童心理学家，帮助过不少问题儿童走回正路，也因此获得市政府的表扬[8]；不过因勤于工作而偶尔疏于陪伴妻子安娜。一晚，一名麦坎多年前治疗不成功的青少年文生·葛雷闯入麦坎家中，枪击麦坎腹部后，再举枪自尽。\n翌年的秋季，麦坎逐渐走出了枪击阴霾，却面临一件与文生类似的病例——拥有阴阳眼的8岁男孩柯尔。柯尔长久以来饱受枉死鬼魂的困扰，让他十分害怕，这种恐怖的遭遇让他无法对他人启齿，连母亲琳恩都无法了解他的怪异行为。麦坎起初并不相信鬼魂的存在，但因柯尔的行为表现和自己无法治好的文生相似，因此决定尽全力来帮助柯尔。然而，在听了一段录音带后，麦坎终于相信鬼魂确实存在。\n在治疗柯尔的同时，麦坎医师发现自己的婚姻状况出现问题，妻子安娜不但冷落他，而且似乎有了外遇，麦坎同时面对工作上与婚姻上的两个难题而备受困扰。虽然如此，麦坎仍持续开导、陪伴柯尔。在麦坎的建议下，柯尔尝试倾听、帮助鬼魂。他为女孩柯林斯的亡魂申冤，指出她其实是被人毒杀，并提出证据揭发凶手。自此柯尔逐渐接受自己拥有阴阳眼的事实[8]，也得以和母亲修复关系。\n然而，就在成功帮助柯尔走出恐惧后，麦坎回家后从安娜的喃喃自语中发现自己其实已经死亡，原本应给在手上的戒指却在安娜那里。种种迹象在麦坎脑中闪过，许多人无视他、安娜另找新伴等现象都得到解释，而柯尔说过的一句话“那些鬼魂都不知道自己已经死了”更让他顿悟。原来他早已死在文生的枪下，只是对于未能成功治疗文生和多陪伴妻子耿耿于怀，所以还未安息。如今，麦坎已经治疗了和文生有类似状况的柯尔，于是在完成最后一个目标——告诉妻子她是他最重视的一切——后，就安然地离开人世。\n","slug":"story","date":"2024-12-06T03:26:15.000Z","categories_index":"","tags_index":"","author_index":"Huix"},{"id":"b9663f58f18133b35bfe243f3e916a80","title":"Hello World","content":"Welcome to Hexo!
